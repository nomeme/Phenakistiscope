# Phenakisticope

This Repository contains the files to build a [Phenakistiscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistiscope).
All you need is a **3D Printer** and a **Laser Cutter**.

## Description

The Phenakisticope consists of a round wooden plate with holes and a wooden handle to hold it.
The handle and plate are joined using several parts that can be printed with any average **3D-Printer**.

On the opposite side of the handle certain patterns can be engraved into the plate to create an animation.
When looking through the holes onto a mirror while rotating the plate the still images morph into an animation.
